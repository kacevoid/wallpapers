# Wallpapers!

last updated: *24Jan31* @18:52CST

You've stumbled onto my public repoitory of wallpapers.

I got tired of bundling some of these in with software themes for my own personal use, and linking to private repos is a pain, so time for a dumpster-file of things I don't mind spreading around for the sake of my own software convenience, and to let others grab some drip where applicable.

## What is all this

All of these are from old work's scrap piles, quick digital sketches, or specifically unbranded for universal use in some cases, but all are CC0 now. I appreciate attribution, but it is unnecessary. Enjoy the freebies. I will add more as I clean up my digital design and prototype trove.

## Changes

- removed some walls with leftover personal branding, will replace with debranded ones on next render run. **24Jan31*

## Contributions

Not expecting contributions, but if this fleshes out into something more than a pile of clippings and serves a purpose greater than adding some free flash to the world, this will be updated.
